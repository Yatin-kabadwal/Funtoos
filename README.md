# Jetpack Compose Fun API Explorer

This project is an Android app built using **Jetpack Compose** that connects to multiple fun APIs. It's a great way to explore and experiment with new tech while integrating some interesting and playful features.

## Features

- **Genderize API**: Guess the gender of a name.
- **CatFact API**: Random cat facts to brighten your day.
- **Dog CEO API**: Get random dog images for some puppy therapy.
- **Joke API**: A random joke to lighten the mood.
- **RandomUser API**: Fetch random user details for fun.

## Tech Stack

- **Jetpack Compose**: The UI toolkit for building native UIs in Android.
- **Kotlin**: The programming language used to develop the app.
- **Retrofit**: For making network requests to the APIs.


## How It Works

- The app uses **Jetpack Compose** for UI and connects to each API via **Retrofit** to fetch data.
- For each API, thereâ€™s a dedicated section where you can interact with the feature (e.g., get a random cat fact or dog image).
- All results are displayed dynamically in the app with a fun and interactive UI.
